          <h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>

          <p>
            These Terms of Use and any policies or operating rules posted by us
            on the Site or in respect to the Site constitute the entire
            agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to
            exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use
            shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These
            Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We
            may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any
            time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage,
            delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable
            control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of
            Use is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that
            provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these
            Terms of Use and does not affect the validity and enforceability of
            any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership,
            employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a
            result of these Terms of Use or use of the Site. You agree that
            these Terms of Use will not be construed against us by virtue of
            having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may
            have based on the electronic form of these Terms of Use and the lack
            of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms of Use.
