              Let's Play Bingo is a tool intended to be used for playing Bingo
              in a group setting - this can be either in person or online
              through virtual meetings with screen sharing.
            </p>
            <p className="small-text">
              <strong>Note:</strong> This app does not make use of a database,
              so games are not stored and you cannot access the same game across
              multiple computers or with other people. So in order to play with
              others, you have to have one designated person running the game
              for all players and sharing their screen so that the players can
              see the game board.{" "}

            <p>
              If you have ever played Bingo before, this application should be
              pretty self explanatory. I've done my best to mimic what you
              experience in the bingo halls as closely as possible. If you still
              need help, please reference the guide below for how to use this
              app for hosting your own bingo games!
            </p>

            <section className="margin-top-xxlg padding-top-sm pale-gray-bg"></section>

            <h4 id="game-setup">Game Setup</h4>
            <p>
              First choose someone to be the caller/controller of the game
              board. This person will manage game settings, handle calling the
              numbers, starting/stopping autoplay, and reset the game as
              necessary when someone calls bingo.
            </p>
            <p>
              Choose what settings you wish to play with. You can learn more
              about game settings by reviewing the{" "}
              <a href="#game-modes">game modes</a> section.
            </p>
            <p>
              Use the <a href="/generator">card generation tool</a> to generate
              and print out bingo cards to distribute among your players. If
              playing virtually, you can have your players visit the site
              directly to get cards for themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once players have their cards, the caller should share their
              screen so all players can see the board. Consider mirroring your
              screen to a television or other display by using a device such as
              ChromeCast, AppleTV, Roku, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              If playing virtually, use the screen share option available in
              your meeting application of choice. Examples of apps to use
              include Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Skype, etc. Please
              refer to the application's documentation for how to share your
              screen in that particular app.
            </p>

            <h4 id="pattern-selection">Game Pattern Selection</h4>
            <p>
              On the left side of the caller is a bingo card display that can be
              used to show players what pattern they should be trying to match
              for the current bingo game.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can choose a preset pattern in the dropdown below the display
              (you can type in the dropdown to search!) OR you can click on the
              individual spaces on the bingo card to create your own custom
              pattern!
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>"Crazy" Patterns</strong> - Any pattern that starts with
              the word "Crazy" means it can be played in any direction on the
              card.
            </p>

              <strong>Pattern Listing</strong> you can{" "}

            <h4 id="gameplay-buttons">Gameplay Buttons</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Start New Game</strong> - this button only appears when
              there is not an active game in play. Clicking this button will
              start a brand new game by calling a single random bingo number (or
              all of the wild numbers if playing Wild Bingo).
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Call Next Number</strong> - this button only appears if a
              game is in play. It will be disabled if autoplay is running.
              Clicking this button will call the next number and display it as
              flashing on the board.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Start Autoplay / Pause Autoplay</strong> - this button
              starts the autoplay function or pauses it depending on if it is
              currently running or not.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Reset Board</strong> - this button is disabled if the game
              is currently running, or if there is no game currently in play.
              Clicking this button will show a pop up asking you if you're sure
              you want to reset the board. This will wipe out the current game
              completely so use with caution.

            {/* --------------- Audible Bingo Caller --------------- */}
            <h2 id="audible-caller">Audible Caller</h2>
            <p>
              Let's Play Bingo utilizes an experimental technology called the
              Web Speech Synthesis API. This is primarily used for screen
              readers to read text back to vision impaired people. Support for
              this feature depends on your device and browser combination. If
              speech synthesis is not supported you will receive a message
              indiciating that the "Bingo Caller" option is not available for
              you. Please try another browser or different device if you'd like
              to use this feature.
            </p>

            <section className="margin-top-xxlg padding-top-sm pale-gray-bg"></section>

            <h4>Caller Selection</h4>
            <p>
              If speech synthesis is available and you have enabled the audible
              caller, you will see a list of voices that are available for use.
              The voice selections can vary greatly as they are depdendant upon
              what the device's manufacturer has made available.
            </p>
            <p className="small-text">
              <strong>Note:</strong> This is not something controlled by the
              Let's Play Bingo application.

            <h4>Double Call Mode</h4>
            <p>
              When enabled Double Call mode will audibly call the number a
              second time. <em>For example:</em> the caller will read out I26
              followed by "I 2 6" with each letter and number separated
              phonetically. This is meant to emulate how callers call the
              numbers in bingo halls.
            </p>

            <h4>Chatty Mode</h4>
            <p>
              When enabled Chatty mode will enable additional chatter from the
              audible caller. <em>For example:</em> at the start of every game
              the caller will say "Let's Play Bingo!" or if using the Wild Bingo
              game mode, "Let's Play Wild Bingo!".

            <h2 id="audible-chime">Audible Chime</h2>
            <p>
              With this setting a subtle chime is played before each number is
              called to alert the players that it's time to mark the next
              number.
            </p>
            <p>
              When enabled you will see a list of chimes to choose from. When
              you select a chime it will play a sample of the selection.
            </p>
            <p className="small-text">
              <strong>Note:</strong> This mode can be used in combination with
              the audible bingo caller, or by itself. If used with the audible
              bingo caller it will delay the voice caller by 1 second to
              accomodate for playing the chime sound.

            <h2 id="game-modes">Game Modes</h2>
            <h3>Manual Calling Mode</h3>
            <p>
              This gameplay style is designed for those who have a physical
              bingo ball cage or caller and merely want the use of a board to
              display the called numbers on. When this game mode is active the
              user will be able to click on the numbers to mark them as
              called/active. Clicking on a called number a 2nd time will mark it
              as uncalled and update the previous number if necessary.
            </p>
            <p className="small-text">
              <strong>Note:</strong> This mode can ONLY be activated at the
              beginning before any balls are called, and the option will be
              disabled if a game is running. When activated it will disable all
              other game modes, options and buttons.
            </p>

            <section className="margin-top-xxlg padding-top-sm pale-gray-bg"></section>

            <h3>Skip Unused Numbers</h3>
            <p>
              This game mode when used in combination with selecting a pattern
              will skip any numbers beginning with a letter who's column is not
              being used in the pattern. <em>For example:</em> When playing the
              Small Picture Frame it will skip Bs and Os.
            </p>
            <p className="small-text">
              <strong>Note:</strong> it will still display the numbers on the
              board as if they were called, but if autoplay is on it will mark
              them as called but skip past them and call a new ball. No numbers
              are skipped in patterns that begin with the word Crazy because
              they are expected to be played in any direction.
            </p>

            <section className="margin-top-xxlg padding-top-sm pale-gray-bg"></section>

            <h3>Wild Bingo</h3>
            <p>
              Wild Bingo indicates that the first number called is wild, meaning
              you would mark every number ending in the same digit as the wild
              bingo number. <em>For Example:</em> If the wild number is G56, you
              would mark every number ending in 6. This game mode can be used on
              any pattern.
            </p>
            <p className="small-text">
              <strong>Note:</strong> Even if you select autoplay, when playing
              Wild Bingo the game will pause on the initial call to give players
              time to dab all of the numbers.
            </p>

            <h4>Wild Bingo: Evens/Odds</h4>
            <p>
              This mode is a sub-type for Wild Bingo. Just like wild bingo - the
              first number called is wild. However, in this game mode, you'd
              mark all even or all odd numbers depending on if the wild number
              is even or odd.
            </p>
