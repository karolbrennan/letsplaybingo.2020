            <ul>
              <li>
                Moved all game settings into their own panel on the top right
                hand side.
                <ul>
                  <li>Added a new vertical board mode.</li>
                  <li>Added the ability to turn on/off autoplay.</li>
                  <li>Added a setting for going full screen.</li>

              </li>
              <li>
                Simplified the game control buttons. New Game will take into
                consideration if autoplay is turned on and will change into a
                pause button if it is - or a call button if it isn't.
              </li>
              <li>
                Updated the translation component to be hidden under a globe
                instead of the big drop down menu.
              </li>
              <li>
                Moved last 5 calls to below the board and added the wild ball
                next to it if applicable.

              <li>Updated the About/Donate page.</li>

                  <li>Implemented Prettier for consistent code formatting.</li>
                  <li>
                    Removed unused components and references to things no longer
                    in use.

              </li>
              <li>
                Fixed a bug where if you didn't choose a caller the audible

                Added a way to show the full history of balls called (see show
                full history link below the last 5 calls).
              </li>
              <li>
                Added a confirmation alert before games are reset to prevent

              </li>
              <li>
                Added a way for games to be stored locally so if you
                accidentally refresh or navigate away from the game your game
                will be stored. Games now can ONLY reset if you explicitly click
                reset game and confirm.
              </li>
              <li>
                Improved the mobile view so it doesn't look so horrible. This
                still needs some more work.
              </li>
              <li>
                Added a small reminder of what the Wild Ball is for Wild Bingo

              </li>
              <li>
                Added a new subtle chime option that can be played when balls
                are called along with 10 chime options! This can also be used in
                conjunction with the vocal caller as a heads up that a new ball
                is coming!
              </li>
              <li>
                Upgraded the core technology behind the game and fixed some bugs
                such as voice failing to set on vocal calls randomly.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I know I haven't updated this in an incredibly long time and this
              is long over due. The pandemic was rough for my mental health and
              then I went through 2 pregnancy losses. September of 2021 brought
              us our little rainbow baby so we have been enjoying watching him
              grow and discover the world around him! :)
            </p>
            <p>
              Thanks to everyone who has continued to play and reach out to me
              via email. I never expected this site to end up with so many
              users. I am so glad it was able to bring people together during
              the uncertainty in the last 2 years. Thanks for playing, stay safe
              and healthy!
            </p>

                Unable to pause number calling on some devices
                <p>
                  I have dug into the code and believe I have this fixed,
                  however I have personally been unable to replicate it so I'm
                  kind of fixing it blindly.

                Odd behavior with audible calling
                <p>
                  The audible calling uses an experimental technology called the
                  Speech Synthesis API which is built into the browser. This can
                  sometimes get laggy depending on a variety of factors and can
                  cause unexpected delays in calling numbers out loud. I've made
                  some changes to hopefully help stabilize it, but it can still
                  act unexpectedly. It will help if you don't make any game
                  option changes in the middle of playing.
