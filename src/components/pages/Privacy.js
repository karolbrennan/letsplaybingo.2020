            <h2>Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?</h2>
            <p>
              In short, we may use cookies and other tracking technologies to
              collect and store your information.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be specific, Let's Play Bingo only uses localStorage
              technologies which are strings of text stored in your browser to
              save information about your gameplay preferences and game data.
              These "cookies" do not expire, but if you clear your cookies in
              your browser they will disappear. We do not have a database, and
              we do not store information on any servers. When you visit our
              Site, we will send a request to your browser to check for these
              strings of text. If they exist we will retrieve them so we can
              resume your game or restore your preferences. This is not personal
              information about you, nor does it allow us to access personal
              information about you. It is strictly to improve your experience
              on the Site.
            </p>

            <h2>Is your information transferred internationally?</h2>
            <p>
              No. We do not store any data on our Site, therefore we also would
              not be transferring it internationally.
            </p>

            <h2>What is our stance on third-party websites?</h2>
            <p>
              In Short: We are not responsible for the safety of any information
              that you share with third-party providers who advertise, but are
              not affiliated with, our websites.
            </p>
            <p>
              Specifically: We utilize two third-party applications. Google
